# **Instructions**

* Within  database create a table called `Top1000` and create columns capable of holding all of the data contained within 
`TopSongs.csv` properly.

With all of the data successfully imported into the database, begin working on a Node console application which
will allow you to collect more specialized pieces of data. For example...

  * A query which returns all data for songs sung by a specific artist
  * A query which returns all artists who appear within the top 1000 more than once
  * A query which returns all data contained within a specific range
  * A query which searches for a specific song in the top 1000 and returns the data for it
